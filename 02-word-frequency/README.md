Word Frequency
==============

Write a program that accepts two arguments, an integer `N` and a text file,
reads the text file then prints the `N` most frequent words in sorted order.

- processing should be case-insensitive
- sort output by most frequent words first
- words with the same frequency are to be sorted lexicographically
- disregard any punctuation or other non-alphabetic characters

### Example

Contests of `words.txt`:

```
Water, water, every where,
And all the boards did shrink;
Water, water, every where,
Nor any drop to drink.
```

Expected output for top 5:

```
 4 water
 2 every
 2 where
 1 all
 1 and
```
